    <h2>Message from the Commissioner</h2>
    <p><strong>Nidhi Pandey</strong><br>Commissioner</p>

    <p>Dear Students, Teachers, and Parents,</p>

    <p>On the momentous occasion of Foundation Day 2024 of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS), I extend my heartfelt
        greetings to each one of you. From its humble beginnings in 1963, KVS has grown into an inspiring institution of
        excellence in school education. This remarkable journey continues to evolve, driven by an unwavering spirit of
        innovation and progress.</p>

    <p>What began with just 20 regimental schools has now blossomed into a beacon of knowledge, with 1256 schools
        illuminating the future of our nation. The recent decision by the Government of India to open 85 more Kendriya
        Vidyalayas underscores the government’s firm commitment to providing accessible and inclusive education to all,
        further strengthening our nation’s educational framework.</p>

    <p>The success of KVS stands as a testament to the dedication, passion, and hard work of every individual associated
        with it. On this occasion, I express my deepest gratitude to the teachers, staff, and parents whose tireless
        efforts and invaluable guidance have shaped KVS into the prestigious organization it is today.</p>

    <p>This Foundation Day is not just a celebration of an institution; it is a tribute to the bright future of over 13
        lakh students, the unshakable dedication of more than 50,000 educators and staff, the trust and support of lakhs
        of parents, and the cherished memories of our esteemed alumni. Together, we celebrate our shared legacy and the
        profound impact KVS has had on shaping the future of this nation.</p>

    <p>As we commemorate this occasion, let us renew our commitment to setting new benchmarks in school education and
        nurturing the leaders of tomorrow. I am confident that this journey of service, dedication, and success will
        continue to unfold, creating a brighter and more promising future for generations to come.</p>

    <p>With my best wishes,</p>
    <p>(Nidhi Pandey)<br>Commissioner</p>
